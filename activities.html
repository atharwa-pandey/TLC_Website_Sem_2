                        <p class="events-list">
                          Both the Students' Academic Cell (SAC) and the Teaching Learning Centre (TLC) realized that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all the teachers and students were forced to redefine the teaching-learning process in many ways. A remarkable effort was put by both the teaching fraternity and BITS students to mimic the "regular" teaching-learning process in the turbulent times. Earlier, the feedback was taken on the academic challenges that were faced by both the stake holders due to this emergency shift to online teaching. Based on the survey results, an online teaching workshop was organized by TLC BITS before this pre-planned online I semester 2020- 21. As uncertainty regarding the reopening of the campus prevailed, the Students' Academic Cell and the Teaching Learning Centre jointly solicited feedback using Google forms on the online mode of education, both from faculty and students in the month of November 2020. This Survey aimed at gauging the effectiveness of teaching and learning using the new methods of teaching and communication like Slack, Mentimeter, Nalanda discussion forums, etc., from the point of view of both the stakeholders. It also focused on understanding the students' opinions regarding what changes have worked and what aspects need revisiting for better students' engagement in learning. The Survey also intended to know the teachers' challenges in adapting the online pedagogical practices and their suggestions to enhance the academic rigor and effectiveness.<br/>
                          A staggering number of 1456 students and 110 faculty members participated in this online Survey enthusiastically. Keeping in view the student and the faculty community was extremely busy due to the upcoming comprehensive exams, both SAC and TLC jointly decided to share the results in an open event in the next semester.

Dr. Virendra Singh Shekhawat and Dr. Avinash Gautam acted as the resource persons in these training sessions. Dr. Virendra Singh Shekhawat conducted the first session on Preparing Quizzes/ tests using Google forms, which was attended by 133 participants. Dr. Avinash Gautam conducted the second session which was on using Microsoft Forrms for Preparing Quizzes/ tests and after sharing marks after correcting the same. This was attended by 93 participants.<br/>
                          Overall both the sessions were very well received. Both the resource persons answered the questions and cleared the doubts of the participants. Overall, participants found the sessions very useful, as the sessions were conducted just before the test 1 series which was to commence in the next week.

                          The Teaching Learning Centre of BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus, Hyderabad Campus and Goa Campus had organized a two-and-a-half days International Conference on “Best Teaching Practices for Engaged Student Learning” from 13 to 15 February, 2020 in the K.K. Birla Goa Campus. With 68 participants from various background and discipline, the conference included key note addresses, plenary session, workshops, and a panel discussion on pedagogy and student engagement by various stake-holders. The key note addresses were given by noted educationists and pedagogy-specialists like Prof. Pankaj Jalote, Prof. Adrian Lee, Prof. Cecilia KY Chan, Prof. Sahana Murthy, Dr. Rajlakshmi Guha, and Prof. Patrick Das Gupta.  They discuss pertinent issues related to effective teaching in higher education, strategies for student engagement, innovative ways to assess learning outcomes and best practices for nurturing students for life-long learning. The plenary session and panel discussion focus on experiential learning and student engagement both in and outside the class rooms. 25 participants also presented posters highlighting their unique pedagogical intervention for making learning fun for the students. The “Sparkler Talk”, given by ten of the poster-presenters generated a significant amount of interactions and brain-storming. The conference ended with a valedictory and a lot of hope among the participants to bring in some of the prescribed practices to their own classroom teaching.

                          The SEER (Sharing Experience and Educational Research) series is envisioned during the Fall of 2018 to be a once in a month TLC forum activity to discuss research articles in teaching-learning and to share unique pedagogical practices by the BITS faculty members. It was planned that a SEER session would typically have two sessions of thirty minutes each where a faculty member would present his/her research on pedagogy and its best practices in the first half, while another faculty member would share his/her teaching experience with the BITS community. The aim is to generate discussion and debate and to learn from each other. <br/>
                          The following SEER talks were organized in the year 2019:<br/>
                          •	The first session of SEER was held on 31/01/2019 where Dr. Pankaj Kumar Sharma from the Department of Biological Sciences discussed a paper titled “Can Undergraduate (Biology) Students Learn to Ask Higher Level Questions?” by G. Marback-Ad and P.G. Sokolove. Prof. Ashoke Sarkar, our Director for Pilani campus, was the second SEER speaker who shared his valuable experience regarding teaching in BITS Pilani in the second half of the session. <br/>
                          •	The second session of SEER took place on 28/02/2019 where Dr. Kaushar Vaidya from the Department of Physics discussed a paper titled “Peer Instruction: Ten years of experience and results” by Catherine Crouch and Eric Mazur. Prof. P. Srinivasan from the Department of Mechanical Engineering shared his insightful experience of classroom teaching in BITS Pilani. <br/>

                          •	The fourth session of SEER, on 24/09/2019 saw Prof. Navneet Goyal delivered a talk titled “Relating Machine Learning concepts to Academic/Pedagogical Practices” where he explained how he had simplified machine learning concepts in classroom by drawing analogies from pedagogical practices and academic models

A total of 26 students including 6 research scholars participated in the essay writing. Based on the evaluations of a six-member committee comprising of BITS faculty, eight essays are chosen in the top five ranking (with a tie in the 1st, 2nd, and the 5th position). The winners are invited to share their key ideas with the BITS community in an hour-long function on 05/04/2019.

                          The TLC conducted an Intensive Teaching Workshop (ITW) for 12 newly recruited faculty members. The entire exercise was divided into three major segments: ITW 1, ITW 2 and ITW 3. The ITW 1 saw nine modules presented by various domain experts on July 25-26, 2019. The inducted faculty members enjoyed the background information provided in these sessions and enthusiastically interacted with the resource faculty. The ITW 2 saw new faculty members attending “open” classes to have hands-on experience on pedagogical practices that they could emulate from their colleagues. Some faculty members from various departments “opened” up the classes for the same. The participating faculty members liked this experiment very much. In the ITW 3 was organized as once in a week format from August 22 to September 26.  The newly recruited faculty members were requested to make a mixed presentation using both black board and slides in front of their colleagues and six external experts from various department. The interaction and feedback followed each presentation and the faculty members benefitted greatly from such an exercise. The ITW 3 was coordinated by Dr. Pankaj Kumar Sharma of Biology Department.

The whole process was later shared with the broad community in an informative session on September 10, 2019. Both the student and faculty community appreciate this exercise and urge the TLC to continue with this practice.
